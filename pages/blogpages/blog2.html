                    Guys, I'm just as guilty as the rest of you, but we can do better!!! Just putting this out there for
                    whoever needs to hear it.
                    "Lost your way and Google maps saved you? Can't imagine a day without your smartphone? When was the
                    last time you legit CLOSED your computer?"
                    We know that smartphones were made for us to make our work easier but what if you need to work from
                    home also which is so hard because it means work is always right there with you AT HOME!!!
                    Today, the computer is indispensable, and its presence has become very important and necessary in
                    our daily lives, and it has become easier for us to do many operations and activities.
                    A computer is an electronic device that receives information and data, automatically stores it
                    retrieves it at any time, and uses it in a useful manner. The computer converts different types of
                    numbers and solves intractable mathematical equations very quickly and with high accuracy.
                    The computer was invented in the second half of the twentieth century and now it has become the
                    backbone of life.
                <ul type="&#149" style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;"> Let's see:</ul>
                <li style="font-size:20px;  padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Respond to client/co-worker emails after
                    5:00 or feel a compulsion to do so immediately?
                    <br> Sometimes, we do not use computers overtime because we want to, but we have it. Have you ever
                    been exhausted without needing to walk? The truth is yes!! and this is because of using computers
                    and smartphones for more than it is needed to. The work provided is overloaded that a person is
                    compiled to work more than they want to.
                    however, few of them use computers because they are so addicted to it.
                <li style="font-size:20px;  padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Maintain the same level of performance on
                    weekends as week-days?<br>
                    As said that some do not want to engage too much on their computers, some even work extra on other
                    days to not work too much on computers a day.
                </li>
                </li>

                <p style="font-size:20px;  padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;"> Modern computers have significantly
                    enhanced computational power and speed, allowing individuals and organizations to perform complex
                    tasks and process large amounts of data in a fraction of the time compared to earlier computing
                    technologies. This increased efficiency has revolutionized various industries, such as finance,
                    healthcare, and manufacturing, enabling streamlined operations and improved productivity.
                    The advent of modern computers has facilitated seamless communication and global connectivity.
                    Through the internet and networking technologies, people from different parts of the world can
                    connect, collaborate, and share information in real-time.Modern computers are the backbone of
                    numerous technological advancements and have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Their
                    importance lies in their ability to enhance efficiency, connectivity, and access to information,
                    while also driving innovation and problem-solving.However,
                    Prolonged computer use can lead to various physical health problems. For instance, staring at
                    screens for long periods can cause eyestrain, dryness, and discomfort, often referred to as digital
                    eye strain.Extensive screen time and reliance on computers can have psychological consequences.
                    Studies suggest that excessive digital technology use may lead to heightened symptoms of
                    attention-deficit, impaired emotional and social intelligence, and even addiction-like behaviors.
                    not only that but,the blue light emitted by computer screens can interfere with the body's natural
                    sleep-wake cycle and make it harder to fall asleep at night. Other medical problems can be seen from
                    Excessive computer use which often involves prolonged periods of sitting, leading to a sedentary
                    lifestyle. Lack of physical activity can contribute to various health issues, including obesity,
                    cardiovascular problems, and metabolic disorders.
                    While computers can enhance cognitive skills in certain contexts, excessive computer use may hinder
                    cognitive development in children and adolescents. Research suggests that prolonged screen time may
                    affect attention span, memory, and cognitive abilities negatively.
                    <br><br>It is important to note that moderate and appropriate computer use, along with practicing
                    healthy habits, can mitigate these potential harmful effects. Regular breaks, maintaining proper
                    posture, adjusting screen brightness, using blue light filters, and practicing good sleep hygiene
                    can help promote a healthier computer usage experience.
                    Please keep in mind that the effects of computer use can vary from person to person, and individual
                    circumstances may also play a role. It is always advisable to be mindful of one's computer usage
                    habits and take necessary precautions to maintain overall well-being.
