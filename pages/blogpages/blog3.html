               <small>On 17th June 2022,</small><br><br>
               Nearly a trillion dollars are used to fund the global printing industry each year.
               This is fairly impressive for an industry whose growth is mainly marked by printing labels and packaging.
               In fact, the printing industry is estimated to be eight times larger than the video game industry and
               also rivals the massively influential auto industry.
               The rapid growth of the printing industry can be contributed to a lot of things. One of the main reasons
               is the importance of the printing industry in the realm of business and entrepreneurship. Many custom
               printing companies are known to help big and small businesses along the way.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul type="&#149" style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;"> If you guys are still wondering
               how the printing business are enormously growing in today's world here are top five reasons.</ul>
            <li style="font-size:20px;  padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Tangibility<br>
               The printing industry enables a lot of advertisement materials like posters, brochures, flyers, business
               cards, and billboard advertisements to come to life. These are some of the requirements of the business.
               They are also impressive tools to attract and engage customers and potential clients. Many proofs show
               that printed ads garner more traction than digital ads.
               Studies also show that people find printed ads to be less annoying than digital ones. They are also more
               effective as there are more chances of visibility and to make a sale with printed ads rather than digital
               ones.
            </li>
            <li style="font-size:20px;  padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Establishment<br>
               In simpler words, high-quality printing establishes your brands and helps your business get more
               visibility from the common folks.
               The more people see them, the more will they become engaged, helping you garner profits and visibility.
            </li>
            <li style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Credibility<br>
               When you use a high-quality business card or a flyer to advertise your company, it adds a certain level
               of credibility to your business, as human beings are very visual creatures.
               They take note of the prints, and the colors. They would notice whether your product has high-quality
               print and good content.
               If you can pass at both of them, your business will be more likely to gain exposure and visibility. It
               will help you get noticed by your customers and potential clients.
            </li>
            <li style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Engagement<br>
               The world is becoming more technologically advanced.
               However, printed products still have more lasting effects than digital ones.
               This is because, in the case of digital products, people just spend some time on one page and then lose
               interest and browse something else.
               In the case of physical prints, they would take some time to read them and might get more enthralled and
               interested.
            </li>
            <li style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Notability<br>
               Online advertisements are considered to be more annoying than physical ones.
               Therefore, more people would be interested to read a printed ad than a digital one.
               They are better portion tools and can be used to increase customer acknowledgment and sales.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:20px; padding:20px; line-height: 1.5;">Finally, having printers in-house allows
               businesses to have more control over their printing needs and timelines.
               This can be particularly beneficial when urgent or confidential documents need to be printed.
               Overall, the printer business is important due to its significant impact on various sectors, the
               relevance of print media, the advancements in printing technology, the enhancement of visual branding,
               and the ability to have control over printing needs.
